## Description

This repository holds a demo Jupyter Notebook for molecule classification using Graph Neural Networks, specifically Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNs). This project aims to predict Molecular Species (ACID, BASE, NEUTRAL, ZWITTERION) for each molecule.

The data has been obtained from [ChEMBL](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/g/#search_results/compounds).
